# Academic Projects

A collection of academic projects completed during my university studies, showcasing my development journey from foundational programming concepts to advanced software engineering. This repository spans multiple years of coursework and culminates in a comprehensive capstone project.

## Repository Structure

### Year 1
- **[INF154 Practical 10](./Year%201/INF154Pract10u21507628)** - A windows forms Dice Game that has the ability to roll a die, store the rolled value into an array which mathematical analysis can be performed on such as getting the average of the rolls.
  - **Tech Stack**: .NET 6.0, Windows Forms App
  - **Key Features**: Random number generator
    - Analysis of rolls: Sum, average and grouping of rolls
    - Display of Previous rolls, Image of rolled dice and Output for Analysis.
  - **Learning Outcomes**: Random number generation
    - Windows Forms App design and manipulation (Throughout the whole semester Module*)
    - Arrays
    - Array functions and additional application of arrays and lists.
    - String manipulation
    - Critical thinking and basic arithmetics.
