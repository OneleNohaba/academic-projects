    3. Navigate to the project directory: `Year 2/Assignment 3`.
    4. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
    5. In your MS SQL Server instance, create a new database for the application using the provided SQL scripts located in the `Assignment 3` folder.  First run the `library.sql` script to create the empty database, then run the `drop and create Archive.sql` to add the necessary `Archive` table.
    6. Add/Edit the database connection through the Tools > Connect to Database option in Visual Studio to point to your local SQL Server instance.
    7. Build the solution to restore dependencies.
    8. Run the application using Visual Studio's built-in debugger or by executing the compiled binary from the output directory.
